# Insights From The Past Five Years

**Perfectionism Is Bad**

Perfectionism is totally the prettified extremism. You can't make things perfect, if you try, you'll only make things worse. Good enough is perfect, that's it. Abandoning idea of being perfect will pay you off enormously.

**No One Can Get Things Well Done At Once**

I have to say human are smart, very smart, but not as much as we think they are. A lot of people always want to hide their terrible process and only present the wonderful part, which is deceptive, making you think that you are only one step away from the good. In fact, the things that one can think about at a time are quite few, maybe just one. Learn to split problem, and solve it one by one, even if there are some overlap. Or take an elementary stuff, improve it, which is usually better and easier.

**Plan Is Important**

Follow your passion? No! Passion is like fuel, power. You can't follow it. Even yes, that's only suitable for short-term thing. For long-term thing, you have to get a plan, planing your time, steps, and goals etc. Even though you don't quite follow it in the end. Time wasted in hesitation is much more than you think.

**No Rule For All Things**

I have been having a viewpoint: what you can talk is knowledge, what you cannot talk is wisdom. Reality is a enormous, complex system, and any rule is just a extrem simplified description about it. Rules aren't bad, but you should learn them and use them, not blindly follow them. Be wary of those who are full of 'formulas'. Ironnically, this sentence may also adhere to the principle. 

**Take Risks**

There is risk in everything. It is attached with opportunity. If you refuse it then you refuse all things attached on it. Choose reasonable risks, and take it.

**All Qualities Have Their Downsides**

Curiosity is good? Enjoying thinking is good? Liking reading is good? Yes, but limited. When in a suitable situation, it's good, when not, not. Learn to distinguish where it is good and where it's not. And learn to control them, it's a high-level capability. Don't let them rule you, if so, you will be confused.

**Success > Failure > Done Nothing**

Denzel Washington once said in a speech: "if you don't fail, you are not even trying. If you want to get something you never had, you have to do something you never did". Any success not through failure is just luck, which just means you are a lucky guy than a good guy. If you want to get success, you have to try and try, and if you give it lots of tries, you definitely will fail a lot of times. It's the sign of your trying. Failure is always better than done nothing.
